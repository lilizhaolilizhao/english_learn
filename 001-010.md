# 001 make and do 的用法

I've just made myself a cup of tea and I should do some housework soon

but, it got me thinking about two words

that many students find very difficult to use.

Today, I want to talk to you about 'make' and 'do'.

So why are these words so difficult to use?

The answer is that both words have very similar meanings

and, in many languages

they use just one word

like 'hacker' in Spanish.

So what is the main difference?

Well with 'make' you are creating something that didn't exist before.

Whilst with 'do' you're completing a task that already exists.

Now please remember as with all English concepts there always exceptions and I will talk about those after I've explained the most important parts.

So things that we can create from scratch:

A coffee or tea: shall I make you one?

An offer: I'd like to make you an offer.

Can I make a suggestion?

Alright, but only if you make me a promise.

Also: I think I've made a mistake.

I'd like to make a complaint!

Who's making that noise?

I've made a really important discovery.

Most things to do with business go with make

for example: profit and loss

Last month I made a loss

but this month I want to make a profit.

You can also make an investment

into somebody else's business.

If you're sure that your football team is going to win

It could be an idea to make a bet on them to try and rear some extra cash.

And also, if things go really well for you and you earn a lot of money

You will have made a fortune.

Now let's talk about ' do '.

I've already told you that 'do' is when you complete a task that already exists

For example: every night I do my homework.

Next week I have to do a test.

In science we did experiments.

I hop I don't have to do any interviews soon !

Next summer, I think I'll do a language course.

Housework chores are tasks, and that's an important one to remember

I hate doing the shopping.

I don't mind doing the dishes

but I loathe ( and that means really hate)

doing the ironing .

You can also do well or badly at something.

I did badly in an exam last summer, so now I have to do it again.

You can do bad or good.

Doing good is doing something positive

if you eat healthily, you do yourself good.

You also do your best, or do your worst.

If you run a race, you should do your best to try achieve the best possible time.

I've got my red pen out !

It's exception time and and unfortunately

there are many exceptions to do with 'do ' and 'make '.

I told you that most things to do with money and business go with make

However, have you ever heard the phrase 'pleasure doing business with you ' ?

Business, just the word, goes with do.

We do business with someone.

I also said that housework and chores go with do.

But when I get up in the morning I should make my bed.

I also said that make was to do with creation.

So we create art , right?

Wrong! We do a drawing.

And finally, girls, hair and make-up.

I do my hair, and I also do my make-up.

Ooh! Sorry! Just doing my lipstick.

Um, that's it for 'make' or 'do '.

I really hope you learnt something

and I would really appreciate it if you subscribe

and also if you attempt the quiz that I'm showing next.

You can leave your answers in the comments

and I will try and correct them all.

Bye bye !
